# UAS Drone Log App
The UAS Drone Logbook is a browser-based flight tracking application designed for drone pilots to log flight data, manage pilot and aircraft credentials, and monitor compliance with FAA guidelines. Built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, the app stores all user data locally in the browser, eliminating the need for external databases or servers.

This application supports full user authentication, enabling each pilot to securely manage their own records. Once signed in, users can log individual flight entries with details such as date, flight duration, mission type, and battery performance. The dashboard provides real-time statistics including total flight hours, number of flights, average flight time, and average battery usage.

Pilots can also store their license and drone registration details, with automatic reminders for upcoming expirations. A built-in resources section provides FAA guidelines for safe and legal drone operation, helping users stay informed and compliant.
